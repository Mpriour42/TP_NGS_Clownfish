#TP NGS Clownfish

Readme du projet NGS Marthe 

**Specie**: _Amphiprion ocellaris_
**Problem of interest**: analysis of the skin transcriptome to find _saiyan_, a candidate gene involved
in the presence of iridophores in white skin.
**Data-set**: for each skin color (orange and white), 3 individuals have been sampled: 3x2 = 6 samples. Each sample has been sequenced using Illumina Single-End (50 bases reads).

**Analyses steps**:
1) Raw RNA-seq data download. See the script "RNAseq_data_download.sh"

2) Data assembly
